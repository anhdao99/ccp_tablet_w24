                <p>With crispy bits of pork, a peppery bite, and a velvety cheese sauce enriched with eggs, carbonara is just as easy to make for dinner as it is at 2 a.m. after a long night out. It’s one of Rome’s signature dishes, and just like cacio e pepe and other pasta recipes in that class, its simplicity demands proper technique and quality ingredients.</p> 
                <p>Cured meat adds a salty depth to the dish, and while guanciale is the most traditional choice, diced pancetta or bacon also work well. Egg yolks give the carbonara sauce its luscious texture and golden hue, so pick up farm-fresh eggs if you can. And when it comes to the cheese and pasta, this is the time to spend a little extra: Buy a wedge of Romano cheese or real Parmigiano Reggiano and a nice box of spaghetti, bucatini, or rigatoni.</p>

                <h3>Recipe Ingredients: 4 servings</h3>
                <ul class="items">
                    <li>3 Tbsp. kosher salt, plus more</li>
                    <li>4 oz. guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl), pancetta (Italian bacon), or bacon</li>
                    <li>2 oz. Parmesan or Pecorino Romano</li>
                    <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 lb. spaghetti, bucatini, or rigatoni</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
                <ol class="items">
                    <li>Heat 6 qt. water in a large pot over high. When water starts to steam, add 3 Tbsp. salt and cover pot with a lid (this will bring water to a boil faster).</li>
                    <li>While you are waiting on the water, do a little prep. Remove 4 oz. guanciale from packaging and cut into about 1x¼" strips. Finely grate 2 oz. cheese and set aside one-quarter of cheese for later.</li>
                    <li>Whisk 4 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs in a medium bowl until no streaks remain, then stir in remaining grated cheese. Add several cranks of pepper and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Working next to pot, heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Add guanciale and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp around the edges, 7–10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove pot from heat. Using a wooden spoon, fish out guanciale and transfer to a small bowl. Pour fat into a heatproof measuring cup, then add back about 3 Tbsp. to pot. Discard any remaining fat.</li>
                    <li>Cook 1 lb. pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes shy of package instructions. Just before pasta is finished, scoop out 1¾ cups pasta cooking liquid with same heatproof measuring cup.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 cup reserved pasta cooking liquid to Dutch oven and bring to a boil over medium-high. Drain pasta in a colander, then transfer to Dutch oven.</li>
                    <li>Cook pasta, stirring constantly and vigorously, until al dente and water is reduced by about half, about 2 minutes. Remove pot from heat.</li>
                    <li>Whisk ¼ cup reserved pasta water into egg mixture, then very slowly stream into Dutch oven, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and egg is thickened to form a glossy sauce. Season with salt, if needed. Thin sauce with remaining ½ cup pasta cooking liquid, adding a tablespoonful at a time, until it's the consistency of heavy cream (you most likely won’t use all of it).</li>
                    <li>Mix in guanciale and divide pasta among bowls. Top with pepper and reserved cheese.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>These fudgy date brownies are a great alternative for anyone cutting processed sugar out of their diet. Instead of sugar they contain a paste made from dates- so naturally sweet and chewy. </p>
                <p>They aren’t overly sweet of course, but sweet enough to taste rich and decadent. Date paste is the only sweetener in the actual brownie, but I did use a little raw honey in the glaze just for fun. (You could do the same with brown rice syrup, agave, or maple syrup.)</p>

                <ul class="items">
                    <li>1 1/2 cups pitted dates</li>
                    <li>1 cup hot water</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter softened (1 1/2 sticks)</li>
                    <li>2 cold eggs</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup cocoa powder</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
                    <li>Sea salt for sprinkling</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
                <ol class="items">
                    <li>Grease or line an 8x8 baking pan. Preheat oven to 350F.</li>
                    <li>In a food processor or blender, puree the dates and hot water until smooth. Measure out a cup of the paste (mine yielded exactly a cup,) and transfer to a large bowl with the butter.</li>
                    <li>Cream the butter and date paste until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Add the eggs, one at a time and vanilla extract, mixing until fluffy and smooth.</li>
                    <li>Add the cocoa and flour, and mix on low until well combined.</li>
                    <li>Spread batter into prepared pan, smoothing with the back of a spoon. Sprinkle a little sea salt on top.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 18-23 minutes, or until edges are set. Allow pan to cool while you prepare the glaze.</li>
                    <li>Whisk together the butter, honey and cocoa powder. Add vanilla and whisk until smooth. If the glaze seems a little runny- add a dash more of cocoa powder. If it seems too thick- you can add a splash of milk. Drizzle over the brownies and sprinkle with more sea salt.</li>
                    <li>Brownies will last for up to a week in a sealed container in the fridge.</li>

                <p>Though modern variations come in many forms, the original Espresso Martini is a simple combination of vodka, espresso, and coffee liqueur. The drink originated in the 1980s and has seen its popularity vary wildly in the decades since, from one of the most visible representations of the pre-Millennium ’tini era, to a forgotten punchline, followed by a massive resurgence in recent years, almost four decades since its first creation.</p>
                <p>The Espresso Martini essentially follows the same template found in everything from the Manhattan to the Old Fashioned—a base spirit mixed with sweet and bitter elements in balance. Rather than using ingredients like sweet vermouth or Angostura bitters to provide the latter flavors, the Espresso Martini simply uses coffee as its bittering agent, sweetened with a touch of liqueur.</p>
